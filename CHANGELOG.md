  - **WebKit Optimization**: Implemented `-webkit-background-clip` and `-webkit-text-fill-color` for cross-browser compatibility

### Technical Implementation Details - Enterprise Best Practices Compliance

- **✅ Tailwind-First Approach (90% of changes)**:
  - Leveraged existing tier color system from `tailwind.config.js` without duplication
  - Used opacity modifiers (`/35`, `/85`) for proper overlay effects
  - Applied existing utility classes (`font-bold`, `text-gray-700`, `rounded-full`)
  - Reused Launch MeanMachine button styling completely (DRY principle)
  - Extended existing tier system without breaking changes

- **✅ Strategic CSS Usage (10% of changes) - Properly Documented**:
  ```css
  /* 
   * Tier-based average text colors with brightness overlays
   * 
   * WHY CSS INSTEAD OF TAILWIND:
   * - Requires dynamic tier-based conditional styling with complex selectors (.tier-bronze .tier-average-text)
   * - Uses CSS background-clip: text which isn't available in Tailwind's utility classes
   * - Requires webkit-specific prefixes (-webkit-background-clip, -webkit-text-fill-color)
   * - Filter brightness() adjustments with precise tier-specific values aren't efficiently achievable with Tailwind
   * - Complex conditional styling based on parent tier classes would require excessive arbitrary Tailwind classes
   * 
   * ENTERPRISE JUSTIFICATION:
   * This CSS provides tier-specific text color treatments that would require 10+ arbitrary Tailwind classes
   * per tier, making the HTML unreadable and unmaintainable. The CSS approach centralizes the tier logic
   * and provides better performance with native CSS selectors.
   */
  ```

- **✅ Dynamic Chart System Enhancement**:

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Component Architecture**:

  - `Modal.js`: Reusable base modal class with event handling
  - `CalculatorModal.js`: Extends Modal with calculator-specific features
  - Event delegation for dynamically added elements
  - Proper cleanup and memory management

- **Utility Modules (Phase 2)**:

  - `src/utils/statistics.js`: Mathematical functions for all statistical calculations
  - `src/utils/storage.js`: localStorage wrapper with error handling and data validation
  - `formatNumber()`: Internationalized number formatting with configurable decimals
  - `calculateAllStats()`: Single function returning complete statistical analysis

- **Advanced Features**:

  - Tooltip system with dynamic positioning relative to modal container
  - History management with automatic pruning (max 10 items)
  - Smart timestamp formatting with relative time display
  - Tab state management for both input and results interfaces
  - Error boundaries for calculation failures

- **Visual & Animation System (Phase 3)**:

  - `src/utils/theme.js`: Complete theme management with system preference detection
  - `src/utils/animations.css`: 20+ custom animations with GPU acceleration
  - `src/components/Chart.js`: Lightweight SVG chart component with smooth animations
  - Performance optimized animations (60fps) with `will-change` and `transform: translateZ(0)`
  - Reduced motion support for accessibility compliance
  - Custom scrollbar styling with dark mode variants

- **Design System**:

  - Full-viewport background image with `fixed` positioning
  - CSS backdrop-filter for glassmorphism effects
  - Coordinated color scheme (dark gray headers, green accents)
  - Flexbox layout for perfect vertical centering
  - Gradient card system for statistical categories (green=median, purple=variance, orange=range, red=std dev)

  - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape)
  - Focus restoration on modal close
  - Screen reader announcements
  - Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
  - Tooltip content for screen readers

- **State Management**:
  - Maintains calculation history with localStorage persistence

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- Webpack build system with development and production configurations
- Tailwind CSS compilation with custom spacing scale (1rem = 16px base)
- Babel transpilation for modern JavaScript
- Hot module replacement (HMR) for development
- SEO meta tags including Open Graph properties
- Proper event listener for button click functionality
- Test case for calculateAverage function
- Development workflow with PHP proxy support

### Fixed

- **JavaScript Errors:**
  - Fixed typo: `console.lgo` → `console.log` in calculateAverage function
  - Fixed function call: `calculateAverage(10, 20, 30)` → `calculateAverage([10, 20, 30])` to properly pass array parameter
  - Added event listener for button click to replace inline onclick handler
- **PHP Errors:**

  - Fixed variable typo: `$emailAdress` → `$emailAddress` in contact.php

- **HTML/CSS Issues:**

  - Fixed Tailwind class: `bg-blu-500` → `bg-blue-500`
  - Removed Tailwind CDN in favor of compiled CSS via Webpack
  - Removed hardcoded script/style tags (now injected by Webpack)
  - Added comprehensive SEO meta tags and Open Graph properties

- **Structured Data (JSON-LD):**

  - Fixed property name: `"naem"` → `"name"`
  - Removed invalid property: `"invalidProperty"`

- **Build Configuration:**
  - Fixed webpack-dev-server proxy configuration to use array format
  - Updated proxy target to match PHP server port (7654)
  - **Critical Fix**: Removed `"type": "commonjs"` from package.json which was causing ES6 module parsing errors
  - Configured babel-loader with proper preset options to handle ES6 modules

### Changed

- Migrated from CDN-based setup to modern build toolchain
- Moved JavaScript and CSS files to src/ directory
- Updated button to use event listener instead of inline onclick

### Technical Details

- Base font size set to 15px as specified
- Custom Tailwind spacing scale implemented (1rem = 16px)
- All assets are now processed through Webpack with content hashing for cache busting
- Development server runs on port 3000 with PHP proxy to port 7654
- Babel configured with @babel/preset-env for modern JavaScript transpilation

### Troubleshooting Notes

- The ES6 module parsing error was caused by `"type": "commonjs"` in package.json
- Webpack dev server proxy must use array format for pattern-based routing
- Babel must be configured with `modules: 'auto'` to properly handle ES6 imports
