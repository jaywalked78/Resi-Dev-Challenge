## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- Webpack build system with development and production configurations
- Tailwind CSS compilation with custom spacing scale (1rem = 16px base)
- Babel transpilation for modern JavaScript
- Hot module replacement (HMR) for development
- SEO meta tags including Open Graph properties
- Proper event listener for button click functionality
- Test case for calculateAverage function
- Development workflow with PHP proxy support

### Fixed

- **JavaScript Errors:**
  - Fixed typo: `console.lgo` ‚Üí `console.log` in calculateAverage function
  - Fixed function call: `calculateAverage(10, 20, 30)` ‚Üí `calculateAverage([10, 20, 30])` to properly pass array parameter
  - Added event listener for button click to replace inline onclick handler
- **PHP Errors:**

  - Fixed variable typo: `$emailAdress` ‚Üí `$emailAddress` in contact.php

- **HTML/CSS Issues:**

  - Fixed Tailwind class: `bg-blu-500` ‚Üí `bg-blue-500`
  - Removed Tailwind CDN in favor of compiled CSS via Webpack
  - Removed hardcoded script/style tags (now injected by Webpack)
  - Added comprehensive SEO meta tags and Open Graph properties

- **Structured Data (JSON-LD):**

  - Fixed property name: `"naem"` ‚Üí `"name"`
  - Removed invalid property: `"invalidProperty"`

- **Build Configuration:**
  - Fixed webpack-dev-server proxy configuration to use array format
  - Updated proxy target to match PHP server port (7654)
  - **Critical Fix**: Removed `"type": "commonjs"` from package.json which was causing ES6 module parsing errors
  - Configured babel-loader with proper preset options to handle ES6 modules

### Changed

- Migrated from CDN-based setup to modern build toolchain
- Moved JavaScript and CSS files to src/ directory
- Updated button to use event listener instead of inline onclick

### Technical Details

- Base font size set to 15px as specified
- Custom Tailwind spacing scale implemented (1rem = 16px)
- All assets are now processed through Webpack with content hashing for cache busting
- Development server runs on port 3000 with PHP proxy to port 7654
- Babel configured with @babel/preset-env for modern JavaScript transpilation

### Troubleshooting Notes

- The ES6 module parsing error was caused by `"type": "commonjs"` in package.json
- Webpack dev server proxy must use array format for pattern-based routing
- Babel must be configured with `modules: 'auto'` to properly handle ES6 imports
